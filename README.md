Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience and formal education in graphic design. I have an eye for detail and explore software problems with minimalism in mind. These days I spend most of my time building apps using React, TypeScript and Node.js.

I'm an advocate for progressive enhancement, web standards and accessibility, and try my best to rely, in order, on the three core technologies that make the web the awesome place that it is: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I love pushing the boundaries of what HTML and CSS can achieve - especially when it comes to animations and interactivity - before introducing Javascript into the mix.

I don't shy away from back-end or devops work when it's needed too, and did my fair share of CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, database, server and serverless type work recently. :)
