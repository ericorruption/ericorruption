Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a software developer with over 10 years experience and a background in graphic design. I was born in Brazil and currently reside in Hamburg, Germany.

I work at Claimsforce, where I mainly write front-end code in order to improve how insurance claims are handled for all parties involved.
