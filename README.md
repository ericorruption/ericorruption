Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a Front-End developer / engineer with over a decade of experience and a background in graphic design. These days I spend most of my time building user interfaces with React and TypeScript. I also dabbled in Flutter, Dart and React Native not too long ago.

I'm a huge advocate for progressive enhancement, web standards and accessibility, and try my best to rely, in order, on the three core technologies that make the web the awesome place that it is: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I love pushing the boundaries of what HTML and CSS can achieve - especially when it comes to animations and interactivity - before introducing Javascript into the mix.

I also don't shy away from back-end work when it's needed, and did my fair share of cloud infrastructure, database, server and serverless type work recently. :)
